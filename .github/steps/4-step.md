## Step 4: Few-Shot Prompting - Mastering Patterns

Excellent progress with one-shot prompting! Now you'll discover how multiple examples create powerful patterns that enable sophisticated AI responses with complex formatting and consistent quality.

### üìñ Theory: Few-Shot Prompting Fundamentals

> [!NOTE]
> Few-shot prompting provides multiple examples (typically 2-5) to establish clear patterns and help the AI understand complex requirements or specialized formats.

**Benefits of Few-Shot Prompting:**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple examples help AI identify consistent structures
- **Complex Formatting**: Enables sophisticated layouts and specialized formats
- **Domain Expertise**: Shows variations within professional standards
- **Robust Consistency**: Reduces edge cases and formatting errors
- **Style Flexibility**: Demonstrates acceptable variations within guidelines

**When to Use Few-Shot Prompting:**
- Complex formatting requirements that one example can't capture
- Specialized domain knowledge or professional standards
- Need for consistent style across varied content types
- Pattern recognition tasks requiring multiple data points
- Technical documentation with specific conventions

**Example Selection Strategy:**
- Choose examples that showcase different aspects of the pattern
- Include edge cases or variations within your requirements
- Ensure examples are high-quality and representative
- Cover the range of scenarios you expect to encounter

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Master Few-Shot Prompting

1. **Create your Few-shot prompts workspace**:

```bash
touch few-shot-prompts.yml
```

2. **Add these few-shot prompt templates**:
   
```yaml
# Few-Shot Prompt Practice
# API Documentation
prompt: |
  Write API endpoint documentation following these examples:
  
  Example 1:
  POST /api/users
  Purpose: Create a new user account
  Parameters: email (string, required), password (string, required), name (string, optional)
  Response: 201 Created with user object, 400 Bad Request if validation fails
  
  Example 2:
  GET /api/orders/{id}
  Purpose: Retrieve order details by ID
  Parameters: id (integer, required, path parameter)
  Response: 200 OK with order object, 404 Not Found if order doesn't exist
  
  Example 3:
  DELETE /api/sessions/{token}
  Purpose: Logout user and invalidate session
  Parameters: token (string, required, path parameter)
  Response: 204 No Content on success, 401 Unauthorized if token invalid
  
  Now write documentation for a WhatsApp webhook endpoint that receives message status updates.
ai_response: "[Test this prompt and paste the response here]"

# Test Case Writing:
prompt: |
  Write test cases following these examples:
  
  Example 1:
  Test ID: TC001
  Feature: User Registration
  Scenario: Valid email registration
  Given: User is on registration page
  When: User enters valid email "test@example.com" and password "SecurePass123!"
  Then: Account is created and confirmation email is sent
  
  Example 2:
  Test ID: TC002
  Feature: Password Reset
  Scenario: Reset with invalid email
  Given: User is on password reset page
  When: User enters non-existent email "fake@nowhere.com"
  Then: Generic message "If email exists, reset link sent" is displayed
  
  Example 3:
  Test ID: TC003
  Feature: File Upload
  Scenario: Upload oversized file
  Given: User has file larger than 10MB
  When: User attempts to upload the file
  Then: Error message "File size exceeds 10MB limit" is shown
  
  Now write test cases for WhatsApp message delivery failure scenarios.
ai_response: "[Test this prompt and paste the response here]"

# Product Requirements
prompt: |
  Write a product requirement section following these examples:
  
  Example 1:
  REQ-001: User Authentication
  Priority: High
  Description: Users must authenticate using email and password
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Login form validates email format
  - Password must be 8+ characters with special character
  - Failed login attempts locked after 5 tries
  - Session expires after 2 hours of inactivity
  Dependencies: None
  
  Example 2:
  REQ-002: Order Tracking
  Priority: Medium  
  Description: Customers can track order status in real-time
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Order status updates automatically
  - Tracking page shows current location
  - Email notifications sent on status changes
  - Estimated delivery time displayed
  Dependencies: REQ-001, Payment Gateway Integration
  
  Example 3:
  REQ-003: Mobile Responsiveness
  Priority: Medium
  Description: Application adapts to mobile screen sizes
  Acceptance Criteria:
  - Works on devices 320px width and above
  - Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
  - Readable text without horizontal scrolling
  - Fast loading on 3G connections
  Dependencies: REQ-001, REQ-002
  
  Now write a requirement for WhatsApp message template management functionality.
ai_response: "[Test this prompt and paste the response here]"
```

3. **Test each prompt** and compare the structural consistency with your one-shot attempts

4. **Analyze pattern recognition** - Notice how multiple examples help AI understand:
   - **Structural Variations**: Different content types following same format
   - **Professional Standards**: Industry-specific conventions and terminology  
   - **Edge Case Handling**: How to adapt patterns to unusual scenarios
   - **Quality Consistency**: Maintaining standards across diverse content

5. **Experiment with pattern variations**:
   - Try 2 vs 4 examples - does more always help?
   - Use examples with intentional variations in style
   - Test with examples from different difficulty levels
   - Mix good and mediocre examples to see the impact

6. **Document your pattern insights**:
```yaml
# Few-Shot Pattern Analysis
# Pattern_observations:
formatting_consistency: "[How well did AI follow complex formatting patterns?]"
pattern_types: "[Which types of patterns worked best with multiple examples?]"
quantity_vs_quality: "[Did more examples always improve quality?]"

# Best Practices
example_selection: "[Your insights about example selection and ordering]"
consistency_vs_variation: "[How to balance consistency with variation]"
advantages_over_one_shot: "[When few-shot provides significant advantages over one-shot]"

# Professional Ppplications
technical_documentation: "[Where few-shot prompting excels in technical documentation]"
specialized_formats: "[How multiple examples help with specialized formats]"
```

7. **Commit your few-shot expertise**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Mastered few-shot prompting with pattern recognition"
git push origin main
```

### üéØ Key Insights

**Pattern Power**: Multiple examples create robust templates that handle variations while maintaining consistency.

**Quality Through Repetition**: Patterns shown multiple times become deeply embedded in AI responses.

**Professional Standards**: Few-shot prompting excels at capturing domain-specific conventions and formatting requirements.

**Diminishing Returns**: More examples aren't always better - quality and diversity matter more than quantity.

<details>
<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

- **Inconsistent patterns?** Ensure your examples are truly representative and high-quality
- **AI mixing different formats?** Make your examples more distinct or add explicit pattern instructions
- **Too complex?** Start with 2-3 examples and gradually add more if needed
- **Pattern not clear?** Add a brief explanation of what makes the pattern consistent across examples
