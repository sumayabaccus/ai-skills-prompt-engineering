# Few-Shot Pattern Analysis
# Pattern_observations:
formatting_consistency: "[How well did AI follow complex formatting patterns?]"
pattern_types: "[Which types of patterns worked best with multiple examples?]"
quantity_vs_quality: "[Did more examples always improve quality?]"

# Best Practices
example_selection: "[Your insights about example selection and ordering]"
consistency_vs_variation: "[How to balance consistency with variation]"
advantages_over_one_shot: "[When few-shot provides significant advantages over one-shot]"

# Professional Ppplications
technical_documentation: "[Where few-shot prompting excels in technical documentation]"
specialized_formats: "[How multiple examples help with specialized formats]"
Pattern Observations
formatting_consistency:
The AI followed formatting patterns very well when examples were clearly structured and labeled. Consistent use of headers (e.g., "Test ID", "Feature", "Scenario") and bullet points helped the model replicate the format accurately across different domains like test cases, API docs, and product requirements.

pattern_types:
Patterns that included both structure and content guidance (e.g., user stories, test cases, API docs) worked best. These examples provided a clear scaffold for the AI to follow, especially when the format was repeated across multiple examples.

quantity_vs_quality:
More examples generally improved quality when they were diverse but still aligned in structure. Three examples seemed to be a sweet spot‚Äîenough to establish a pattern without overwhelming or diluting the prompt.

‚úÖ Best Practices
example_selection:
Choose examples that are:

Representative of the range of expected inputs
Varied in content but consistent in structure
Clear in intent and free of ambiguity
Ordering matters too‚Äîstarting with the most typical or foundational example helps set expectations.

consistency_vs_variation:
Maintain structural consistency (e.g., headers, bullet points) while varying content (e.g., different features or scenarios). This helps the model generalize the format without overfitting to specific content.

advantages_over_one-shot:
Few-shot prompting is especially advantageous when:

The format is complex or domain-specific
The task requires both structure and nuance (e.g., bug reports, product specs)
You want to guide tone, style, and level of detail
üíº Professional Applications
technical_documentation:
Few-shot prompting excels in generating:

API documentation
Integration guides
Configuration instructions
It ensures consistency across endpoints or modules while adapting to specific parameters.
specialized_formats:
Multiple examples are particularly helpful for:

Compliance checklists
QA test cases
User stories and acceptance criteria
They help the model internalize domain-specific language and formatting expectations.

specialized_formats: "[How multiple examples help with specialized formats]"
formatting_consistency:
The AI followed complex formatting patterns with high accuracy. When examples were clearly structured‚Äîusing consistent headers, indentation, and bullet points‚Äîthe model replicated the format reliably across different content types (API docs, test cases, product requirements). Even subtle formatting cues like optional vs. required parameters or acceptance criteria lists were preserved.

pattern_types:
Patterns that combined both structure and semantic intent worked best. For example:

API documentation with method, purpose, parameters, and response
Test cases with Given/When/Then structure
Product requirements with ID, priority, description, and acceptance criteria
These formats provided both a visual and logical scaffold, making it easier for the model to generalize.
quantity_vs_quality:
More examples improved quality up to a point. Three examples per prompt appeared optimal‚Äîenough to establish a clear pattern without overwhelming the model. Adding more examples beyond that didn‚Äôt significantly improve output and sometimes introduced redundancy.

‚úÖ Best Practices
example_selection:
Select examples that:

Represent a range of realistic use cases
Vary in content but not in structure
Include both typical and edge-case scenarios
Ordering matters: start with the most common or foundational example to set the tone, then introduce variation.
consistency_vs_variation:
Maintain structural consistency (e.g., same headers, bullet formatting) while varying the content (e.g., different features, endpoints, or scenarios). This balance helps the model learn the format while demonstrating flexibility in application.

advantages_over_one-shot:
Few-shot prompting is significantly better than one-shot when:

The format is multi-part or domain-specific (e.g., API specs, bug reports)
The task requires both structure and nuance
You want to guide tone, level of detail, or domain vocabulary
One-shot may suffice for simple tasks, but few-shot ensures reliability and completeness in complex outputs.
üíº Professional Applications
technical_documentation:
Few-shot prompting excels in:

API documentation
Integration guides
Configuration and setup instructions
It ensures consistency across endpoints or modules while adapting to specific parameters or use cases.
specialized_formats:
Multiple examples are especially helpful for:

QA test cases
Compliance checklists
Product requirement specs
They help the model internalize domain-specific language, formatting expectations, and edge-case handling.

üß† System Architecture Decision
Prompt: Choose between REST API and GraphQL for a WhatsApp integration service.

AI Response:

Requirements Analysis:
WhatsApp integration typically involves sending and receiving messages, handling delivery receipts, and managing templates. These operations are transactional and often follow a fixed structure.

REST vs. GraphQL Comparison:

REST is well-suited for fixed, resource-based operations like sending messages or retrieving status updates.
GraphQL excels when clients need to query flexible or nested data structures, which is less common in WhatsApp messaging.
Trade-offs:

Performance: REST is more efficient for simple, predictable endpoints. GraphQL can reduce over-fetching but may introduce complexity.
Complexity: REST is easier to implement and debug. GraphQL requires a schema and resolver setup.
Maintainability: REST aligns well with WhatsApp‚Äôs structured API model and is easier to maintain in small teams.
Team & Infrastructure:
If the team is already familiar with REST and the infrastructure supports RESTful services, introducing GraphQL may not be justified.

Recommendation:
Use REST. It aligns with WhatsApp‚Äôs API design, is easier to implement, and suits the predictable nature of the integration.

üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Strategy
Prompt: WhatsApp integration has 15% message delivery failures.

AI Response:

Information Gathering:
Collect logs, timestamps, message IDs, error codes, and recipient metadata. Check API response codes and retry behavior.

Reproduction:
Simulate message sending under similar load and network conditions. Use test accounts to replicate failures.

Investigation Steps:

Analyze failure patterns (e.g., time of day, recipient region).
Check for API rate limits or quota breaches.
Review webhook logs for delivery receipts.
Root Cause Isolation:
Narrow down to specific failure types (e.g., timeouts, invalid numbers, expired tokens). Correlate with infrastructure metrics.

Solutions & Validation:

Implement retries with exponential backoff.
Improve error handling and logging.
Validate by monitoring delivery success rate post-fix.
Prevention:
Set up alerts for failure spikes. Add dashboards for delivery metrics. Conduct regular load testing.

üí∞ Cost Optimization Analysis
Prompt: WhatsApp Business API costs increased by 300%.

AI Response:

Data Collection:
Gather usage reports, message volume by category (session vs. template), region, and time.

Potential Causes:

Traffic spike
Pricing tier change
Inefficient message retries
Unused templates triggering charges
Evaluation:

Traffic spike: High likelihood if new campaigns launched
Pricing change: Check vendor communication
Retry loops: Check logs for repeated failures
Investigation Steps:

Compare message volume month-over-month
Audit retry logic and template usage
Review billing breakdown
Optimization Strategies:

Consolidate templates
Reduce retries
Use session messages where possible
Prioritization:

High impact, low effort: Retry logic fix
Medium impact: Template consolidation
High effort: Session message redesign
Monitoring Plan:

Weekly cost dashboards
Alerts for usage anomalies
Monthly billing reviews
üîê Security Risk Assessment
Prompt: Evaluate storing WhatsApp webhook secrets in environment variables.

AI Response:

Security Principles:
Confidentiality, integrity, and least privilege.

Proposal Analysis:
Environment variables are better than hardcoding but still exposed to processes with access to the environment.

Attack Vectors:

Insider access
Misconfigured CI/CD pipelines
Memory dumps
Alternatives:

Secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
Encrypted config files with access control
Operational Complexity:
Secrets managers add setup overhead but offer better auditability and rotation.

Recommendation:
Use a secrets manager for production. Environment variables are acceptable for local/dev use only.

Implementation Steps:

Migrate secrets to a vault
Update deployment scripts
Rotate existing secrets
‚öôÔ∏è Performance Optimization
Prompt: Scale WhatsApp integration from 1,000 to 10,000 messages/hour.

AI Response:

Current Bottlenecks:
Analyze message queue latency, API response times, and database write throughput.

Component Limits:

Message queue capacity
API rate limits
Worker thread pool size
Scaling Approaches:

Vertical: Increase instance size
Horizontal: Add more workers and load balancers
Reliability & Complexity:
Horizontal scaling improves fault tolerance but adds orchestration complexity.

Cost Implications:
Vertical scaling is simpler but hits limits quickly. Horizontal scaling is costlier upfront but more sustainable.

Implementation Phases:

Phase 1: Optimize code and DB queries
Phase 2: Add horizontal scaling
Phase 3: Introduce autoscaling and monitoring
Success Metrics:

99% message delivery within 5 seconds
<1% failure rate
CPU/memory usage under 70% during peak]"
