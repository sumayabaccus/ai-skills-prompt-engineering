ai_response: "[Subject: WhatsApp Integration Project ‚Äì Revised Timeline and Next Steps

Dear Stakeholders,

I hope this message finds you well.

I‚Äôm writing to inform you that the WhatsApp integration project will be delayed by approximately two weeks. I sincerely apologize for this shift and any inconvenience it may cause.

The delay is due to a combination of technical challenges, including unexpected complexities in message routing and API authentication. Our development team is actively addressing these issues to ensure a secure and seamless integration that meets our quality and compliance standards.

We now anticipate completing the integration by [insert revised date], with testing and deployment to follow shortly thereafter.

Next Steps:

Finalize API configuration and security validation by [insert date]
Conduct end-to-end testing and QA by [insert date]
Prepare training and deployment materials for customer service teams
We remain committed to delivering a robust solution and will keep you updated on progress. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss the revised timeline in more detail.

Thank you for your continued support and understanding.

Warm regards,
Sumaya Baccus
Business Analyst]"

# One-Shot Prompt Practice
# Code Review Comment
prompt: |
  Write a constructive code review comment for a pull request. Here's an example:
  
  Example: "Great work on implementing the user authentication! I noticed the password validation could be strengthened by adding a check for special characters. Consider using a regex pattern like /^(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])/ to ensure at least one special character. This would align with our security standards. Otherwise, the logic flow looks solid!"
  
  Now write a similar code review comment for a WhatsApp integration module that has good error handling but lacks proper logging.

# User Story Writing
prompt: |
  Write a user story following this format:
  
  Example: "As a customer service manager, I want to view real-time chat metrics on a dashboard so that I can monitor team performance and identify bottlenecks during peak hours. Acceptance criteria: Dashboard updates every 30 seconds, shows active chats, average response time, and agent availability."
  
  Now write a user story for a customer who wants to receive automated WhatsApp notifications about their order status.

# Bug Report
prompt: |
  Write a detailed bug report using this structure:
  
  Example: "**Title:** Login form validation fails with special characters
  **Environment:** Chrome 120, Windows 11, Production
  **Steps to Reproduce:** 1) Navigate to login page 2) Enter email with + symbol 3) Click submit
  **Expected Result:** User should be logged in successfully
  **Actual Result:** Error message 'Invalid email format' appears
  **Priority:** Medium - affects users with email aliases"
  
  Now write a bug report for WhatsApp messages not being delivered during peak hours.

# Status Update Email
prompt: |
  Write a project status update email following this example:
  
  Example: "Subject: Weekly Update - Mobile App Redesign Project
  
  Hi Team,
  
  Here's our progress update for Week 12:
  
  ‚úÖ **Completed:** User interface mockups for login and dashboard screens
  ‚úÖ **In Progress:** Backend API integration (60% complete)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked:** Waiting for design approval on payment flow
  üìÖ **Next Week:** Complete API integration, begin user testing preparation
  
  Risk: Design approval delay may push testing back 3 days. Mitigation: Parallel work on other screens.
  
  Questions or concerns? Let's discuss in our Friday standup.
  
  Best regards,
  Sarah"

‚úÖ Code Review Comment
Prompt:
Write a constructive code review comment for a WhatsApp integration module that has good error handling but lacks proper logging.

AI Response:
"Nice job on implementing robust error handling in the WhatsApp integration module! One area for improvement is logging‚Äîcurrently, there‚Äôs limited visibility into the flow and failure points. Consider adding structured logs at key stages (e.g., message send attempt, API response, and fallback logic) using our standard logging utility. This will help with debugging and monitoring in production. Otherwise, the error management logic looks solid!"

‚úÖ User Story Writing
Prompt:
Write a user story for a customer who wants to receive automated WhatsApp notifications about their order status.

AI Response:
"As an online shopper, I want to receive automated WhatsApp notifications about my order status so that I can stay informed without checking the website manually.
Acceptance Criteria:

Notifications are sent for order confirmation, dispatch, and delivery
Messages include order ID and estimated delivery time
Opt-in and opt-out options are available in the user profile settings"
‚úÖ Bug Report
Prompt:
Write a bug report for WhatsApp messages not being delivered during peak hours.

AI Response:
Title: WhatsApp messages fail to deliver during peak hours
Environment: WhatsApp Business API v2.45, Production, AWS EU-West
Steps to Reproduce:

Send a message via the WhatsApp integration between 6 PM and 8 PM
Observe delivery status in logs or customer interface
Retry message outside peak hours
Expected Result:
Messages should be delivered promptly regardless of time.

Actual Result:
Messages remain in "pending" state or fail with timeout errors during peak hours.

Priority: High ‚Äì impacts customer communication and SLA compliance

‚úÖ Status Update Email
Prompt:
Write a status update email for the WhatsApp integration project covering week 8 of development.

AI Response:
