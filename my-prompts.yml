Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we begin the requirement analysis phase for the new WhatsApp project, I want to ensure that we have a comprehensive understanding of the objectives, scope, and expectations. To conduct a thorough and accurate analysis, I would appreciate your input on a few key areas:

The primary goals and success criteria for the project
Any specific features or integrations that are expected
Target user groups and anticipated usage scenarios
Known constraints, timelines, or dependencies
Any existing documentation or reference materials
Having this information will help us align our analysis with the project’s strategic direction and avoid any assumptions that could impact delivery.

Please let me know a convenient time if you'd prefer to discuss this in a quick call. I’m happy to coordinate accordingly.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Warm regards,
Sumaya Baccus
